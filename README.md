🌍 Empowering Sudan’s Agriculture with Space Technology
Smart Agriculture using HAPS, Drones, AI, 5G, and ArcGIS
By Abdelwahab Rayis & Afraa Rayis

📌 Project Overview
This project explores how space-based technologies and intelligent systems can revolutionize Sudan’s agricultural sector. Combining HAPS (High-Altitude Platform Systems), drones, AI, 5G, and ArcGIS, we present a modern, scalable approach to climate-resilient agriculture.

🚜 Why It Matters
Sudan’s agriculture faces challenges like:

✅ Climate Change (droughts, desertification)

✅ Water Scarcity

✅ Lack of modern technology

Our solution uses remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and automation to increase yields, optimize resources, and support sustainable farming practices.

🔧 Technologies Used
Technology	Role
🛰 HAPS	Continuous large-area monitoring (soil, crops, climate)
🚁 Drones	Detailed, low-altitude crop inspection and precision farming
🧠 AI	Predictive analytics, crop disease detection, smart insights
🌐 5G	Real-time data transfer and control of remote devices
🗺 ArcGIS	Visualization of farm conditions, smart mapping, and decision support

🔁 Workflow
Data Collection – via HAPS and drones

Processing – with AI models

Transfer – using 5G networks

Visualization – in ArcGIS web apps

Intervention – guided decisions on irrigation, spraying, etc.

📈 Key Benefits
📍 Real-time decision-making

💧 Efficient water and resource use

🌿 Early detection of crop issues

📊 Increased productivity and food security

🌱 Support for digital twin agriculture systems

🧪 Case Study
Gezira Irrigation Scheme, Sudan
✔ HAPS and drones monitor crop and flood zones
✔ AI analyzes risks and optimizes field decisions
✔ ArcGIS maps used by field engineers for real-time interventions

🎯 Future Goals
Expand IoT device coverage

Build national-level agricultural data infrastructure

Train local communities and policymakers on smart tech adoption

Partner with global space and AI organizations
